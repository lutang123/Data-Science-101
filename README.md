# Data-Science-101

This Repo aims to present part of my Data Science learning journey and to share project-based learning materials organized and edited by myself. This Repo covers topics like ‘Use basemap to plot map on geo data’, ‘Analyzing database with SQL’, ‘Access data with API and web scrapping’, ‘Perform Statistics and Probability Analysis with Python’ etc.. The Repo is on-going and will add more topics and make
it a great resource to learn and share.
