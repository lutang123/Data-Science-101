# Data-Science-other-topics

This Repo includes several side projects done by myself, and it aims to present my data science learning journey.

Topics include:

‘Use basemap to plot map on geo data’, 

‘Analyzing database with SQL’, 

‘Access data with API and web scrapping’, 

‘Perform Statistics and Probability Analysis with Python’, 

‘Build Machine Learning models’ etc.. This project is ongoing and will add more topics and make it a great resource to learn and share.
